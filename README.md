# SPARTA
Re-Implementation of [SPARTA: Efficient Open-Domain Question Answering via Sparse Transformer Matching Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13013). It is the re-implementation we used for [BEIR: A Heterogenous Benchmark for Zero-shot Evaluation of Information Retrieval Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08663).

Also have a look at our BEIR repository: https://github.com/UKPLab/beir
